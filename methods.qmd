**Frequency of praying or speaking in tongues.** Measurement of glossolalia comes from one item in the Religious Landscape Survey. Respondents how identified with one of the following Christian traditions -- Evangelical Protestant Tradition, Mainline Protestant Tradition, Historically Black Protestant Tradition, Catholic, Mormon, Orthodox Christian, Jehovah's Witness, Other Christian -- were asked how often they "speak or pray in tongues" with the following response options: at least once a week, once or twice a month, several times a year, seldom, or never.

## Statistical Analysis

To investigate the prevalance of glossolalia in the Christian world I used basic descriptive statistics. To isolate the effect of glossolalia on attitudes I used OLS regression.
