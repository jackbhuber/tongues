# Background {.unnumbered}

In the Christian world, glossolalia is the practice of speaking or praying in "tongues." Glossolalia is particularly associated the Pentecostal tradition which emphasizes the direct "infilling" of the Holy Spirit. While most people who practice glossolalia tend to see it as direct evidence of divine presence, not all will claim that lack of it means lack of divine presence.

## Research Questions

In this study, I use data from a recent national survey to explore the practice of glossolalia in the population of American adults. I pose the following research questions:

1.  Who speaks in tongues? Which traditions? Which demographics?
2.  Correlates of glossolalia. What religious variables are most predictive of glossolalia? Is there something special about speaking in tongues?
3.  Effects of glossolalia on attitudes, psychology well-being?
